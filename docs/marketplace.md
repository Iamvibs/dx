The Marketplace contract allows sellers to list products for sale, manages the purchase of these products, and tracks ownership through ERC721 tokens. It also employs a non-reentrancy guard for transaction security and ownership management via the Ownable contract. A soulbound token mechanism is utilized to verify seller credentials, ensuring that only approved sellers can list products.

# Contract Features

Seller Verification: Only verified sellers can add products, using an external SoulboundToken for authentication.
